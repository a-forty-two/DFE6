MEMORIZE:

1. LOOK and VISUALIZE the data
    1. Graphs and charts
    2. Decisions- 
        1. Which columns to eliminate 
                1. Correlation
                2. Distribution
        2. If any column can be converted to ID
                1. Unique valued or indexed COLUMN
                    1. Customer ID and Index Column 
                    2. You can have a UNIQUE valued column excluded from ML without removing it
        3. Categorical/Discrete or Continuous problem 
        4. In some cases: possibility of GROUPING/AGGREGATION (date time, categories, ZIP codes, cities, states, customer IDsâ€¦) 
                        1. SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG
2. Prepare the data (For ML)
    1. NULL values and MISSING values check!
    2. We may also check for Categorical/Discrete or Continuous columns here
